# Universal Ship Classification System (USCS)
The Universal Ship Classification System (USCS) for Prosperous Universe (PrUn) is a way of identifying a ship's location and purpose instantly and easily.

# Purpose
The main goal of the USCS is to allow ship purposes to be instantly identified without either looking at the modules or inferring it from the name.

Feel free to use and modify USCS as needed.

If you have an idea for a new ID in USCS, please submit a pull request, and I will merge the changes. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please open an issue and explain the issue or question.
